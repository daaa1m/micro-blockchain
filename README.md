# Smol Blockchain

- this is a very simple implementation of a blockchain called SmolCoin in Python using Flask as a server
- SmolCoin uses a simple proof-of-work 
  -- miner has to increment number until it is divisible by 69 and the proof number of last block
  -- then a new block is created and miner given a SmolCoin
- for fun

## future work
- implement some of the stuff from btc whitepaper
  - same PoW
