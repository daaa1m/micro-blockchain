# Smol Blockchain

- this is a very simple implementation of a blockchain called SmolCoin in Python using Flask as a server
- SmolCoin uses a simple proof-of-work 
  -- miner has to increment number until it is divisible by 7 (find the "proof number") and the proof number of last block

## TODO
- consensus mechanism
